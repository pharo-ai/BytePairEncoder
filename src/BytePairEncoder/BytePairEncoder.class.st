I implement the Byte-Pair Encoding: Subword-based tokenization algorithm as defined in A New Algorithm for Data Compression but adapted to NLP as defined in ""Neural Machine Translation of Rare Words with Subword Units""
by Rico Sennrich and Barry Haddow and Alexandra Birch.

BPE is a simple form of data compression algorithm in which the most common pair of consecutive bytes of data is replaced with a byte that does not occur in that data. It was first described in the article ""A New Algorithm for Data Compression"" published in 1994. 

Suppose we have data aaabdaaabac which needs to be encoded (compressed). The byte pair aa occurs most often, so we will replace it with Z as Z does not occur in our data. So we now have ZabdZabac where Z = aa. The next common byte pair is ab so let’s replace it with Y. We now have ZYdZYac where Z = aa and Y = ab. The only byte pair left is ac which appears as just one so we will not encode it. We can use recursive byte pair encoding to encode ZY as X. Our data has now transformed into XdXac where X = ZY, Y = ab, and Z = aa. It cannot be further compressed as there are no byte pairs appearing more than once. We decompress the data by performing replacements in reverse order. 

A variant of this is used in NLP that use the merge rules to tokenise text.



### Basic steps

- Step 0. Initialize.
- Step 1. Represent each word in the corpus as a combination of the characters terminating with a end marker _. We keep a bag to just have to operate on a single representative e.g. `{'low': 5}` to say that `'low'` is present 5 times in the corpus.
- Step 2. Iteratively count adjacent character pairs in all words of the corpus.
- Step 3. Merge every occurrence of the most frequent pair, add the new character n-gram to the vocabulary. Update all the words of the corpus to reflect the fact that the new frequent pair got added to the vocabulary. It means that once we udpate the words we just have torebuild the adjency pairs.
- Step 4. Repeat step 3 until the desired number of merge operations are completed or the desired vocabulary size is achieved (which is a hyperparameter).

Once these steps are performed, we have an extended vocabulary and a list of merges.
Given a new word look into the merge list for the ones that match and apply them one by one in order and we get the new word tokenised.

#### Note
We cannot simply update the pairs because the pairs represent a local information and just updating them is not possible

Imagine that we have 

```
ost
est
...
```
and the adjancy rules

```
e~s
s~t
```

If we merge `e~s` into `es`, we cannot replace `s~t` by `es~t` because `s~t` comes from both `est` and `ost`. 

### Implementation

The current implementation is super naive.  Not a single optimization. 
Read [https://guillaume-be.github.io/2021-09-16/byte_pair_encoding](https://guillaume-be.github.io/2021-09-16/byte_pair_encoding) for possible optimization. 

#### Instance variables
- words: the corpus (the text) is represented as a bag
- vocabulary: we keep the vocabulary as a Set but it could be anOrderedCollection. The vocabulary does not contain characters but string because in the merge phase we have sequences of characters.
- pairs: is a bag containing the adjacent pairs found in the corpus and their frequencies. It holds OrderedCollection and not strings to be able to add merged tokens (`e~s` e followed by s should be replaced by a new characted `es`).
